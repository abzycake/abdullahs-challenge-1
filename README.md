## Description

I was engaged by a marketing company to enhance their website's accessibility and streamline the codebase. My focus was on improving code readability and ensuring accessibility for all users. I achieved this by adding descriptive alt text to images, organizing HTML content with semantic headings, and optimizing CSS for efficiency.

The project aimed to create a cleaner, more accessible website that would be easy for future developers to maintain. By prioritizing accessibility, I ensured that users with disabilities could navigate the site effectively. Throughout the project, I refined my skills in HTML semantics and CSS optimization, resulting in a professional and accessible website that sets a new standard in SEO marketing.
